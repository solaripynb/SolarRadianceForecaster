## <a name="data"></a>2. Data Collection and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Data Sources - PVGIS (c) European Union, 2001-2023

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS), which is a reliable and comprehensive database supported by the European Union. The data provides key metrics such as Global Beam Irradiance (Gb(i)), Global Diffuse Irradiance (Gd(i)), and Global Reflected Irradiance (Gr(i)), along with additional meteorological variables like temperature, wind speed, and solar elevation angle.

### 2.2 Data Cleaning

The initial dataset underwent rigorous cleaning processes, including:

- **Time Alignment**: Ensured that all time series data is aligned in uniform time intervals.
- **Outliers**: Anomaly detection was performed using Z-Score and Tukey Fences methods. Specifically, 680 and 381 anomalies were detected for the `Gd(i)` feature using these methods.
- **Data Types**: Ensured that all columns are of the appropriate data type.

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

To improve the model's predictive capabilities, several new features were engineered:

- **Lagged Features**: Variables like `Gb(i)`, `Gd(i)`, and `Gr(i)` were lagged at 1, 3, and 6 time intervals.
- **Temporal Features**: Hour of the day, day of the week, month, and quarter were extracted.
- **Moving Averages**: 3-period and 6-period moving averages were calculated for key features.
- **Historical Values**: Past day values for the same time were incorporated.
- **Cyclical Features**: Sinusoidal transformations were applied to capture cyclical patterns in hours and days.

### 2.4 Data Imputation

For the anomalies detected in the `Gd(i)` feature, data imputation was performed using the median of the dataset. The median was chosen over the mean for its resistance to outliers. After imputation, the dataset was verified to contain no missing or infinite values.

## <a name="exploratory-data-analysis"></a>3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3.1 Time-Series Plotting

Two types of time-series plotting techniques were used:

- **Temporal Trends**: Time-series graphs of `Gb(i)`, `Gd(i)`, and `Gr(i)` were plotted to understand underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality.
- **Hourly/Daily/Monthly Profiles**: The data were aggregated to hourly, daily, and monthly intervals to visualize diurnal, weekly, and seasonal patterns.

### 3.2 Distribution Analysis

To understand the statistical properties of the data, the following analyses were conducted:

- **Histograms and Density Plots**: These were created for each variable, especially the newly engineered features, to understand their distribution.
- **Box Plots**: These plots were used to understand the spread, skewness, and identify outliers in the dataset.

### 3.3 Correlation Analysis

Correlation between variables was assessed through:

- **Heatmap**: A heatmap was generated to identify highly correlated variables.
- **Pair Plots**: Scatter plots for selected pairs of features were created to visualize relationships.

### 3.4 Statistical Tests

Two types of statistical tests were applied:

- **Stationarity Tests**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests were conducted on `Gb(i)`, `Gd(i)`, and `Gr(i)`, confirming stationarity in these variables.
- **Normality Tests**: D'Agostino and Pearson's tests confirmed that the distributions of `Gb(i)`, `Gd(i)`, and `Gr(i)` were not normal, indicating the need for transformations if parametric methods are to be applied.

### 3.5 Anomaly Detection

Anomalies were identified using:

- **Z-Score and Tukey Fences**: Anomalies were detected predominantly in the `Gd(i)` feature. The data points identified as anomalies were imputed with the median value of the respective variable.

##  <a name="model-evaluation"></a>5. Model Evaluation

### 5.1 Metrics Used

Four key metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the models:

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Represents the average absolute difference between the observed actual outcomes and the predictions made by the model.
2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE. It has the benefit of being in the same unit as the response variable.
4. **Coefficient of Determination (\( R^2 \))**: Represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables in the model.

### 5.2 Model Comparison

Here's a summary of the performance metrics for each model:

| Model                    | MAE (Validation) | MSE (Validation) | RMSE (Validation) | \( R^2 \) (Validation) | MAE (Test) | MSE (Test) | RMSE (Test) | \( R^2 \) (Test) |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Random Forest            | 9.13             | 576.40           | 24.01              | 0.995                  | 9.80       | 620.34     | 24.91       | 0.994            |

### 5.3 Statistical Significance

A t-test was conducted to determine whether the means of the predicted and actual values are statistically different.

- For Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, the p-value was greater than 0.05, failing to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that the means of the predicted and actual values are not statistically different, affirming the model's accuracy.
- For LSTM, statistical testing was not conducted due to the model's different nature and evaluation metric (MAE only).
