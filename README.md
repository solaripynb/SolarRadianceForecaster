# Solar Radiance Forecaster - Spain

## Description

This repository contains an ensemble machine learning model designed to forecast real-time solar radiation reaching solar farms in South Spain for intervals of 30 minutes and ahead. The project aims to assist Solar Grid Operators in the efficient balancing of supply and demand.

## Objective

To provide Solar Grid Operators with accurate solar radiation forecasts for the next 30 minutes and beyond, thereby enabling them to balance the grid efficiently.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:

- **SIS (Solar Incoming Surface radiation)**: The primary target variable for forecasting, measured in Wmâˆ’2.
- **SID (Solar Direct Irradiance)**: Provides information on the direct component of solar radiation.
- **DAL (Daylight)**: Useful for understanding the availability of visible light.

### Meta-Data

The data starts from January 1, 2015, and ends at October 21, 2023. All attributes conform to Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions.

## Methodology

The project adheres to a rigorous data science pipeline, which includes:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Conversion of time columns to datetime data types, sorting, and merging datasets.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Generation of lagged features, temporal elements, moving averages, and cyclical features.
3. **Data Splitting**: 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test splits.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluation of multiple machine learning models.
5. **Model Training**: Training the selected Gradient Boosting Regressor model.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Employing MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, and cross-validation for thorough evaluation.
7. **Deployment**: Real-time forecasting using Flask and `render_template`.

## Modeling

The machine learning model used is a Gradient Boosting Regressor. It is trained on engineered features like:

- Lagged SIS values (`SIS_lag_1`, `SIS_lag_2`)
- Time since sunrise
- Time until sunset
- Moving averages (`short_term_avg`, `long_term_avg`)
- Cyclical features capturing time-based patterns (`hour_sin`, `hour_cos`)

## Evaluation

The model's performance is meticulously evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-Squared (R2)
- Cross-Validation

## Results

Detailed results will be updated upon completion of the model evaluation phase.

## Conclusion

Insights and conclusions will be updated after the evaluation phase.

## Usage

Instructions on how to run the code and use the model for real-time forecasting will be provided.
